    tip 1:
    Open CSV, open with Jupyter Notebook
    format as dataframe
    use pandas function to_html 
    this will convert df to html format to bring into page as a table
    copy/paste output to html inside div tag 

    tip 2: 
    finish index html first (css/style/containers... this is the template)
